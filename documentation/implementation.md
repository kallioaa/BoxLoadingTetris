# Implementation 

In this section, I will introduce you to my implementation implmementation of the algorithm by .... I will start by introducing you to the different classes I used. Then I will move on to explain the main algorithms and how we arrive to the final result.

## Different classes
The most important classes are.

### Cuboid
Cuboids represent items(boxes). A cuboid has a name, dimensions(length, width, height), weight, and demand. Cuboids can be rotated horizontally.

### Container
A Container has a name, dimensions(length, width, height), and a max weight.

### Layer
A layer is formed of homogenous cuboids placed in rows (lengthwise), and these rows are placed next to each other (widthwise).
