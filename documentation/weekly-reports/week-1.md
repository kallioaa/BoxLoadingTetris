# Week I

## First iffy steps

When scrolling through the example topics for the project moving comppany Nopsatoimitus caught my eye. First the idea seems so simple yet after a quick pondering, the complexity of the issue arises. I have used about six hours on this project this week. I feel more aware about the theory of the subject but I am still totally lost with the implementation. 

I thought picking a subject from the examples would guide me through the first stepts. But when I started typing the [specification document](https://github.com/kallioaa/BoxTetris/blob/main/documentation/specifications.md) I quickly understood that futrther counseling with course staff is needed. My main obstacle is setting the right restriction for my implementation of the cubioid packing problem (e.g. rotating the boxes). 

However, my next step is clear -- ask some help -- which is hopefully followed by clarity about next steps.
