# week 4

## Good progress code but lacking on documentation

This week I have spend a lot of hours on coding but been lazy in terms of documentation, so I expect low scores this week. My main logic is almost completed and the 
level of abstraction is good. The code coverage percent is bad at the moment which I need to fix. My plan next weeek is to catch up with the documentation, implment hashmap and finnish the logic and it's tests.
