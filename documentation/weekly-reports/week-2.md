# Week 2

## Too little hours spent on the project...

This week I have spend about 10 hours on the project. Most of my time was spent reading different publications about the subject. I am going to implement a constructive layer building algorithm to 3D-MBPP problem motivated by Saraiva et al., 2015. Next week, I will be able to compensate for my lack of hours put into this course and catch up to the expected progress of the course schedule.


Saraiva, R. D., Nepomuceno, N., & Pinheiro, P. R. (2015). A layer-building algorithm for the three-dimensional multiple bin packing problem: a case study in an automotive company. IFAC-PapersOnLine, 48(3), 490-495.
